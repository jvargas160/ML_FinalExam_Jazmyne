## About

This repository contains my solutions for **Part II (R coding problems)** of my final exam for Machine Learning.  
The problems involve tasks such as:

- Building Random Forest models
- Performing k-Nearest Neighbor classification
- Growing and pruning Decision Trees
- Building a Linear Regression model
- Cleaning a Credit Score dataset
- Performing Unsupervised Learning (Hierarchical Clustering)

The goal was to explore different Machine Learning techniques on a **Credit Score dataset** with over 75,000 entries obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification
